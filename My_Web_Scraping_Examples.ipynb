        "\n",
        "I first learned about web scraping in 2009, when I saw some data on a web site that I wanted in a different format. I didn't like their UI and I had an idea in mind for a better interface for me.\n",
        "\n",
        "Specifically, it was movie data from [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com), and I wanted to visualize connections between cast and movie titles. Based on actors that I liked I wanted to get recommendations on other movies I'd probably like too.\n",
        "\n",
        "I was art coding at the time in [Processing](https://processing.org/) (a subset of Java). I was making replicas of visual effects from the [demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene). I'd previously used C, x86 assembler, and Pascal/Basic/C#, but none of them gave me the ease of use for web scraping that I wanted.\n",
        "\n",
        "The best candidates for web scraping at the time were Ruby and Python, and I decided to learn Python because my best friend knew it and I'd have a friendly person to ask questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **_KEY_** for learning a new language: find a kind mentor\n",
        "\n",
        "My pursuit of learning web scraping took me to work in a research lab focused on Social Network Analysis where I [co-authored two published research papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=gD1PTGoAAAAJ). This led me on a road of learning Python where I eventually became a Python Developer at a hosting company, and subsequently have used it in every position since. I still web scrape for my personal projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How I Scrape\n",
        "\n",
        "This is how I scrape, from easiest to hardest.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Python: requests\n",
        "\n",
        "If the information I'm trying to get is available as a GET/POST HTTP request, or if it's in a web page that's not generated by JavaScript, I can use a plain HTTP request using the [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) library.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are other ways to do this, including using the standard library that comes with the Python distribution, but the requests library for Python is built to be simple.\n",
        "\n",
        "I prefer simple.\n",

        "As you can see, web scraping can be a complex and vast topic. It's a constant cat and mouse game of people building web pages/apps and other people finding ways to scrape that data and functionality. Applications range from liberating data for your own use to getting pricing information from a competitor.\n",
        "\n",
        "What started for me as a simple desire to get movie data has evolved into a skill I've used throughout my career. The web is essentially the world's largest, messiest database, and scraping is my imperfect tool to make sense of it. As you start your own scraping journey, remember that with great power comes great responsibility. Be ethical, be considerate, and maybe even reach out to site owners when in doubt.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most rewarding scraping projects are often ones that unlock data for purposes the original creators never imagined. Maybe you'll visualize weather patterns in your hometown, build a better interface for public transit information, or create a personal dashboard of information that matters to you.\n",
        "\n",
        "What do you think about scraping? If you could scrape a website, which one would it be? I'd love to hear what ideas you have! Drop a comment below or connect with me directly to share your thoughts or questions.\n",
